## Features and requirements 
- Mixed-language code, including C, Matlab, Python, and etc.
- ggplot
- C-free

## Components
- Criticality: the code related the criticality state
- EIbalance: the code related to excitatory and inhibitory balance
- WM_invertedU: the code related to the inverted U behavior of Working memory model
- D1_rest: rest state of WM model

## Acknowledgments
The code of working memory model [2] is requested from Dr. Gianluigi Mongillo, which should be credited to Dr. Gianluigi Mongillo. The authors thank him very much for technical assistance.
